## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-based on my research the Service Oriented Architecture is a design software application that can be used in a business processes using multiple accounts and Service Oriented architecture is available in other platform. SOA is is adaptive when it comes changing in a business and makes the system easier to integrate in some applications
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- supports loose coupling everywhere in the project - this characteristics allows them to easily modifying and reused the data without affecting the whole content of the system and make the system flexible 
- service reusability - is same with the loose coupling it allows to reused without affecting the whole content, and also you can reused instead of creating a new services from the start that reduce the time and cost 
- increases the quality of service - they are having an service contracts based on my service level agreement to meet the requirements and fees for the service to make accountability. it helps to monitor and analyze the service requirements
3. Define Microservices.
- microservices is called as a independent software components that focuses on one task, microservices can communicate to the API for the developers and other software.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- microservices have an access to all local data and also improved the data security by taking smaller task without requiring to run the whole system
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-the similarities of soa and microservices is same loose couplng because they reused without affecting the system, both are scalable because when it comes in load they are balancing the incoming request to reduce and prevents the bottle neck. this can handle the workload to be balance
-difference of SOA and microservices is the size of the services. the soa handles the large services while the microservices handle a small or only single task. when it comes in communication protocols the SOA uses different communication protocols while the microservices uses a lightweight communication protocols
